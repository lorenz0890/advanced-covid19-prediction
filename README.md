## Abstract

Compartmental models are a tool commonly used in
epidemiology for the mathematical modelling of the
spread of infectious diseases, with their most pop-
ular representative being the Susceptible-Infected-
Removed (SIR) model and its derivatives. However,
current SIR models are bounded in their capabili-
ties to model government policies in the form of non-
pharmaceutical interventions (NPIs) and weather ef-
fects and offer limited predictive power. More capa-
ble alternatives such as agent based models (ABMs)
are computationally expensive and require special-
ized hardware. We introduce a neural network aug-
mented SIR model that can be run on commodity
hardware, takes NPIs and weather effects into ac-
count and offers improved predictive power as well
as counterfactual analysis capabilities. We demon-
strate our models improvement of the state-of-the-art
modeling COVID-19 in Austria during the 03.2020 to
03.2021 period and provide an outlook for the future
up to 01.2024
